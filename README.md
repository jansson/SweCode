Keyboard layout for Swedish programmers
Click here to view keymapSweCode is a keyboard layout, based on sv-SE standard, that aims to suit programmers better, by reducing the need for AltGr and moving common programming related keys to a more easy-to-reach location.

Some characters have been duplicated. This is to ease the switching between working in SweCode and standard Swedish keyboards.
